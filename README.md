# ios-categories
iOS Category files, good for reuse

Most categories I have are from external sources, for which I add the link in the corresponding .h file, so you can reference them instead of me.

Categories:
* NSManagedObject+Clone
  Adds functionality to clone a managed object, and to exclude certain (e.g. parent) linked entities to be cloned.
